# Odin-Library

An app where users can create a list of books in a virtual library.
In order to add a book, the user needs to enter a title, an author, the number of pages and whether or not they have read the book.
Once the book has been added, the user can update the status to 'read' if it was originally entered as 'not read yet'.
The user also has the option to remove books from the library
